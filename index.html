  <p>To my Dearest,</p> 
    <p>How are you Telle? Are you doing fine? Up until now I still feel helpless without you and I know it's only been days. I contemplated a lot, and I've realized that I really don't want to part ways with you. I'm deeply sorry for what I've done, as in everything. And, you were right, my messages were really off, I couldn't help but laugh and, at the same time feel disgusted by the things I said. I've reflected and realized that I was too complacent about what we have, and that's why I mistreated you without being aware of the things I've said. I also apologize for the passive-aggressive approach whenever somethings bugging me, especially when I'm in the wrong. I can't help but say this: Can we please fix this? I want to make bawi for the things that I've done.       

      I know you're a high maintenanced girly that's why you deserve everything in this world. I've always said that I want to be better, but this time I'm gonna do it right. Let me show it, let me prove my worth once again. From the bottom of my heart, Im really sorry:((</p>
